Example 1 model answer:
The sky appears blue because of the way sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere. When sunlight reaches Earth, it is made up of a spectrum of colors, with shorter wavelengths like blue and violet being scattered more easily by the gases and particles in the atmosphere. This scattering causes the blue light to be more visible to our eyes, giving the sky its blue color.

Example 2 model answer: 
Why is the sky blue? Why is the world
At endless strife with the spirit of man?
Why do the stars in their courses whirl,
And the planets and suns in their cycles plan
The doom of the earth and the fate of man?
Why is the sky blue?
